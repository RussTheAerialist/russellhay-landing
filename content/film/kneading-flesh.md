For the 48hr film project in the dark comedy genre.  This film is about a massage therapist who takes a creative
approach to a meat shortage.

On this film, I wore many hats, but primarily I was the director of photography and camera operator.  We did not have a
gaffer, so I was also the gaffer, though it is uncredited and fell under the DP role.
