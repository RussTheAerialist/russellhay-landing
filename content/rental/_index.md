# The House

![house front](/house/1448085_1.jpg) ![kitchen](/house/1448085_5_2.jpg)

A charming craftsman-ish house with a large kitchen, great entertainment spaces, and large space
for crafting. Most of the rooms have carpet, and a small home gym in the basement completes the
package.  Large screen tv, ps4, switch, and apple tv in the common space.

The outdoor space is ripe for a home gardener, and entertaining of groups. I would love to collaborate on a garden plan.

Two workshop spaces will be built in the coming year. The basement will be used for crafting,
sewing, soldering, and other "maker" type activities. The shed in the backyard will be turned
into a woodshop for dust-generating processes.

## Accessibility Information

The house is a multistory house and the bedroom for rent is on the upper floor.  The stairwell is a narrow stairwell as was normal in the 1910s when this house was built. The stairs to the basement are open, but missing safety rails currently.

# The Room

![room](/house/1448085_2_2.jpg)

The room is the second room on the upper floor as is around 130 sq ft. It has under-eaves
storage and a small closet with a ceiling fan. It is currently painted yellow, but am willing to
paint to any color you would like (within a selected color palette) prior to moving in.

The upstairs bathroom would be shared with me.

## Rent and Fees

$850 with utilities and internet included.

A security deposit of $300 and first months' rent due upon lease signing, but flexible move in date and lease terms. There is a background check fee paid directly to MySmartMove.

# Me

I'm an early 40s cis-gendered gay man who is in tech. I like to make things, and I'm an early-riser who is very health-conscious.

I workout 4 days a week, and try to eat in every night.

While being health-conscious, I enjoy baking bread and eesserts, and like to experiment with different cooking techniques.

I eat meat, and meat will be cooked in the house.

I am a relatively neat person, but not overly perscriptive about it, and most of my "mess" will be contained in the workshop area.

I'm an avid gamer of board, rpg, and video gamer. I would like to run or host an on-going RPG game which would be for a few hours each week.

# The Ideal You

A member of the LGBTQIA+ community who is sex and body positive, with a job, and who is interested in creating an intentional living situation. Preference to gamers or a person who like to craft so that the workshop doesn't go to waste.  Within walking distance to Versatile Arts, so a circus person would be good too!

You should probably be a morning person too, but that's not a hard requirement, just know that I wake up at 6am most mornings and will be working out in the basement in the morning.

You should be willing to help out with house work and split weekly and biweekly chores.

I would prefer to rent to one person, not a couple, but that's not a hard requirement and we can discuss.

I'm 420 and alcohol friendly, but not okay with smoking and smokers due to allergies. I'm
open to someone with a dog (upon meeting the dog), but cannot accept cats due to allergies also.

# The Process

1. The first step would be to fill out the form here: [Roommate Contact Form](https://forms.gle/qgEkA95uTaWsFJgW9). The questions here are to facilitate the first meeting.
2. We will setup a meeting to see the house and answer any questions you might have
3. If we decide to move forward, I'll send you a link to [mysmartmove.com](https://www.mysmartmove.com/) for a background check.
4. Based on the background check, discuss any potential things that came up from the check. 
5. Lease signing, paint selection and move in.
